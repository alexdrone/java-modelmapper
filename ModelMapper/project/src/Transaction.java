/**
 * Allows for the syntactically simple use of database transactions within 
 * the ModelMapper API.  This class's syntax is modeled after the 
 * <code>transaction do ... end</code> syntax provided by Rails's 
 * ActiveRecord ORM.  The intention
 * is to provide the simplest possible encapsulation around the transaction
 * functionality. 
 * 
 * The design behind <code>Transaction</code> is modeled after the
 * following code snippet:
 * 
 * <pre>new Transaction&lt;Object&gt;(manager) {
 *     public Object run() {
 *         Account a = modelFactory().find(Account.class, "Id = ?", 1);
 *         Account b = modelFactory().find(Account.class, "Id = ?", 2);
 *         
 *         a.setBalance(a.getBalance() - 1000);
 *         a.save();
 *         
 *         b.setBalance(b.getBalance() + 1000);
 *         b.save();
 *         
 *         return null;
 *     }
 * }.execute();</pre>
 * 
 * The transaction will be committed only after the <code>run()</code>
 * method returns.  Thus, <code>a.save()</code> doesn't immediately modify
 * the database values, only upon the committal of the transaction.  If any
 * conflicts are detected, JDBC will automatically throw an 
 * {@link SQLException}. <code>Transaction</code> catches this exception and 
 * rolls back the transaction, ensuring data integrity.  
 + * Once the transaction is rolled back, the exception is rethrown from the 
 <code>execute()</code> method.
 * 
 * In cases where the transaction generates data which must be returned, this
 * can be accomplished by returning from the {@link #run()} method against the
 * parameterized type.  Thus if a transaction to create an account is utilized:
 * 
 * <pre>Account result = new Transaction&lt;Account&gt;(factory) {
 *     public Account run() throws SQLException {
 *         Account back = factory.create(Account.class);
 *         
 *         back.setBalance(0);
 *         back.save():
 *         
 *         return back;
 *     }
 * }.execute();</pre>
 * 
 * The value returned from <code>run()</code> will be passed back up the call
 * stack to <code>execute()</code>, which will return the value to the caller.
 * Thus in this example, <code>result</code> will be precisely the 
 * <code>back</code>
 * instance from within the transaction.  This feature allows data to escape 
 * the scope of the transaction, thereby achieving a greater usefulness.
 * 
 * <p>The JDBC transaction type used is 
 * {@link Connection#TRANSACTION_SERIALIZABLE}.</p>
